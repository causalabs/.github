## Welcome to Causa's Github ðŸ‘‹

At Causa, we're building CausaDB - a CausalOps platform that makes it simple to adopt causal AI technology.

Our client libraries for Python and Node.js are open source and can be found in the links below. We also maintain a growing repository of examples showing how CausaDB can deliver value in different contexts.

[Get in touch](mailto:info@causa.tech) if you'd like more information, or [check out the docs](https://docs.causadb.com) for additional support.
